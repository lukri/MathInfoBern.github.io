As most of you may know, there is a big collection of math exams in our [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7WeH9ZCm3RbRjhISDE3NkdBUWc). But the biggest part of them is rather old and it's a messy folder. And anyhow is it quite annoying to use Google Drive.

Thats why I thought this could do done better, created a proper TeX project and collected the newest 4 exams of **Mathematical Logic** in one nice file. While I am still hoping that I don't have to use next year to repeat the exam.

Here is the final product
[Mathematical Logic Exams 2010,11,12 & 16](../resources/exams/logic.pdf)

If someone wants to help creating a math-students worthy collection of exams, you are welcome to join me.

You can find the repo at:
