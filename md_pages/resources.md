As most of you may know, there is a big collection of math exams in our [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7WeH9ZCm3RbRjhISDE3NkdBUWc). But the biggest part of them is rather old and it's a messy folder. And anyhow is it quite annoying to use Google Drive.

Thats why I thought this could do done better, and created a proper collection of the 4 most recent exams of **Mathematical Logic**, this while still hoping that I dont have to used it to prepare myself for a second exam attempt.

Here is the final product
[Mathematical Logic Exams 2010,11,12 & 16](../resources/exams/logic.pdf)

If you too get a headache when seeing such an unordered collection you are welcome to join me in the task of bringing this in a math students worthy form.

Cheers, *Bruno*
